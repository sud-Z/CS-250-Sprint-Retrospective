Agile is a framework that centers around the needs of the end user. To turn user needs into User Stories, we must turn a complex need into a short and easy to digest sentence. This is usually done with the form “As a [Type of user], I want to [function/action] so that [benefit of function/action]”.  User stories help a team create a better product by baking the user needs into the requirements of the product itself. The whole project is customer driven.

Before this course, I would generally approach development in a very ham-fisted way. Usually all in one sitting if the project was simple enough. While I would develop incrementally and test my code at every step of the way, I don’ t think that this method was healthy or a good use of my time. Moving forward, I intend to purchase a whiteboard so that I can create my own Scrum/Kanban board. This way, I can break my work into small, actionable chunks to save myself some grief, and some sleep. I may even implement time-boxing in an attempt to get as much focused work done as possible.

In software development, a good team member is a hard thing to pin down. Being really good at programming does not make you a good team member, despite what you may believe going into this line of work. One of the most important things, especially in an agile environment is communication. Being able to organize your efforts with your team and work effectively in tandem with others is paramount. Being a lone wolf and charging ahead of your team into the realm of uncertainty on a hunch will only waste your team’s time, and it may even prevent your team from delivering a competent product. A good team member is a well-rounded programmer with great communication skills, someone who isn’t afraid to ask for help, and someone who has pride in their team rather than just themselves.
